# Real Time Bus Tracker


## Description
This is a map animation exercise from Week 9. Utilizing the MBTA public API key and Mapbox, I was able to position a marker along one of the routes of a bus in Boston.

## Installation
The page for this project can be located [here](https://vghsieh.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/). 

## Usage
A map of Boston and surrounding cities will load, centered on Cambridge, MA. When you click on "Click me!" button, a blue marker will show up at the location of where a specific bus is. Every 5 seconds, the marker should move along the bus route.  To zoom in and out, scroll up and down on the mouse wheel. 

## Roadmap
Future ideas:
- have additional buttons that show the path a bus will take, and where the bus is currently located on the path
- try the exercise on a different city (NYC MTA)
